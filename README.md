# SOLID-By-Exemple
Welcome to this repository dedicated to learning and applying the SOLID principles through practical, real-life code examples.
Here you will find legacy anti-pattern code and refactored versions, making it easy to understand the before/after impact of proper software design.

Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, this repo is a valuable reference for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable software.
------ 
### 📚 What You’ll Find Here

- ❌ Legacy code (bad practices)

- ✔️ Refactored code following SOLID

- 🧩 Clear explanations for each principle

- 🧪 Simple unit tests (MS Test)

- 🗂️ Organized structure for easy navigation

- 📘 Examples written in C#

### 🧩 SOLID Principles Covered
| Principle | Name | What It Solves | Example Included |
|----------|------|----------------|------------------|
| **S** | Single Responsibility Principle | Avoids classes that do too much | ✔️ |
| **O** | Open/Closed Principle | Extensible without modifying existing code | ✔️ |
| **L** | Liskov Substitution Principle | Prevents broken inheritance hierarchies | ✔️ |
| **I** | Interface Segregation Principle | Smaller, focused, meaningful interfaces | ✔️ |
| **D** | Dependency Inversion Principle | High-level modules independent of details | ✔️ |️
